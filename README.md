# Java-Backend-Development-with-spring-boot
Project description:

The goal of this project is to build a powerful REST API that handles student data management. The API will enable creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records, with an interactive HTML front-end for testing and verification.
 Any changes made through the API will be instantly reflected on the web page, allowing for a seamless integration between the backend logic and the frontend presentation.

• Engineered robust applications using Java, OOP, and Spring Boot for scalable Software Development.
• Streamlined project setup with Maven for MVC and REST APIs in a fast-growing startup environment.
• Enhanced reliability with advanced exception handling and production-ready releases.
• Collaborated with mentors and peers to refine design and technical coding skills.

Project Setup
Initialize a Spring Boot project and configure the database connection, ensuring the right dependencies are included.

Model Design
Create a Student entity class that maps to the database, utilizing JPA annotations for defining the structure and relationships.

Repository Layer
Implement the CRUD operations for the Student entity using the JpaRepository interface, which provides convenient methods for interacting with the database.

Service Layer
Develop the service layer, responsible for handling the business logic and performing complex operations related to student data management.

Controller Layer
Create RESTful endpoints using Spring MVC controllers, defining the routes and methods for accessing and managing student data through the API.
